# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## 피드백

- border-radius가 부모 el과 자식 el에 같은 value로 설정되있고
  부모 el을 relative로 자식을 absolute로 position을 지정하여
  자식이 부모의 el를 cover하고 부모 el에 overflow:hidden을 설정했을 때,
  부모border-radius부분이 자식 el에 의해서 완전히 덮히지 않고 조금 남아있다.
  왜 그럴까?

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
